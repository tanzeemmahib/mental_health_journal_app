# mental_health_journal_app
A simple mental health journaling web app that lets users log their thoughts, track their mood with emojis, and see a motivational quote each day. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a "self-interest" project and I do not recommend relying on this if you are going through something, please contact professional help.
